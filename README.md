A :+1:[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) dark theme based on :+1:[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) Vector theme.

# Installation
## Download a pre-built release
It's recommanded to download the pre-built css from [Releases](https://github.com/soleverlee/solarized_vector/releases).
Just copy all the contents of the downloaded css file, and edit the `MediaWiki:Vector.css` page in your wiki, it should works.

Remember that this theme only works when you choose the `Victor` theme in your wiki.

## (Optional) Build the css by yourself
You can use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to build the source code, and generate a css file. To install sass please refer to it's document, here is how to install it on OSx:
``` bash
gem install sass
git clone git@github.com:soleverlee/solarized_vector.git
cd solarized_vector && ./make.sh
```
